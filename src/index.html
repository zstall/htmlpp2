			<h3>About Zachary</h3>
			<p>Hello! An educator of 10 rewarding years, and now a fanatic of technology and coding. I have found a passion and have decided to jump in head first. This page will be home to some of my projects, ideas, and a running repository for my growing skill set. I hope to reflect on my time in education (the good, the bad, and the ugly). Along with tech, I enjoy video games, outdoor activities (camping/hiking/running/etc.), my dog and cat, breweries, and spending time with my beautiful wife!</p>

				<h3>Projects: Completed PC Builds</h3>
				<p id="headerp">Ember: After building my first PC, I wanted to step up the aesthetics and improve performance without upgrading too much. I decided to go small form factor with the corsair case and a mini itx mobo. I ultimately upgrading the GPU from a 670 to a 970. Also, to accomodate the small form factor build I went with a fully moduler power supply. Lastly, to increase cooling and overclock my cpu I purchased a thermaltake aio.</p>
