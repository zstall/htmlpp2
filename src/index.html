			<h3>About Zachary</h3>
			<p>Hello! An educator of 10 rewarding years, and now a fanatic of technology and coding. I have found a passion and have decided to jump in head first. This page will be home to some of my projects, ideas, and a running repository for my growing skill set. I hope to reflect on my time in education (the good, the bad, and the ugly). Along with tech, I enjoy video games, outdoor activities (camping/hiking/running/etc.), my dog and cat, breweries, and spending time with my beautiful wife!</p>

			<p id="headerp"><strong>Ammo Can:</strong> The build that started it all! Planning to run and upgrade this machine for a while, I opted for the i7-3770k. The chip served me well and lasted through a handful of upgrades. My brother has claimed this chip now that I've moved on, and still today it works fantastic. To overclock and run this monster I went with the ASUS P8Z77 mobo, 8 gb of ram, 750w power supply and a EVGA GTX 670 ftw. This PC was a great entry into the PC medium, and I enjoyed every second of it!

			<p id="headerp"><strong>Ember:</strong> After building my first PC, I wanted to step up the aesthetics and improve performance without totally starting over. I decided on a small form factor case with the corsair 380T mini ITX and a ASUS P8Z77-I Deluxe/wd mini ITX LGA 1155 mobo. I ultimately upgrading the GPU from a EVGA GTX 670 FTW to a EVGA GTX 1070 FTW with a brief experiment with a ASUS Strix 970 imbetween (later given to my younger brother). Also, to accomodate the small form factor build I went with a fully moduler Corsair 760W 80+ Platinum power supply. Lastly, to increase cooling and overclock my cpu I purchased a Thermaltake Water 3.0 Riing RGB (of course) aio.

			<p id="headerp"><strong>|zero|:</strong> Absolute Zero is my latest build. For this build I went with a i7-8700k, which is major overkill but I like having the overhead to take on new projects. I paired the i7 with an MSI - Z370 Gaming Pro Carbon mobo. I also added a Samsun 960 EVO 250 GB m.2. I brought over all the other storage from my other builds and power supply. Finally, to finish off the build I used a EVGA GTX 1070 FTW 2.0. I love this build, it crushes everything I play on my 1440p Dell monitor.
